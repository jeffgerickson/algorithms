# _Algorithms_
## by [Jeff Erickson](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu)

This is a bug-reporting site for my _Algorithms_ textbook and other related course materials.  Thanks for visiting!

**To report an error, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/jeffgerickson/algorithms/pulls).**  
* Before submitting, please check that your error hasn't already been fixed in the most recent revision.
* For an error in the book, please include the chapter, section, and page numbers.
* For an error in the lecture notes, please include the title and *a complete URL* of the note in question.  (There are _lots_ of old revisions floating around the web, with inconsistent titling and numbering, so just the title or the file name isn't enough.)

While you're here, please feel free to download a complete copy of the most recent revision of the book.

### Additional Materials

The book contains only a small subset of my course materials; you can find hundreds more pages of lecture notes, lab handouts, and past homeworks and exams at  http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms, or at the mnemonic shortcut http://algorithms.wtf.  You can see the material in context at the web sites for my most recent offerings of [CS 374](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs374/sp2018/A) and [CS 473](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs473/sp2017) at Illinois.

At some future date, I am likely to incporporate more (but defeinitely not all) of these lecture notes into a future edition.  (I haven't decided whether I'm going to call it a "director's cut" or an "extended dance remix".)  One step at a time.
